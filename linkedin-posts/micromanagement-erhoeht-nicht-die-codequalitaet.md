The impulse to fix bad code by handing out tasks feels like leadership. It isn't.

When I became CTO, I scrolled through repos with 3000-line files and nested nightmares everywhere. My instinct: assign someone, get a plan, fix it by Friday. Classic. Also completely wrong.

Here's what actually happens with that approach: the identified code gets cleaned up, maybe. Everything else stays exactly as it was. And worse — the team stops thinking for itself. It waits for the next inspection instead of owning quality.

I spent too long thinking I needed to control this myself. Until I realized: if the team knows it, I don't need to know it.

What works instead: anchor quality structurally, build shared ownership, protect time for refactoring, use pair programming as knowledge transfer, hire the developers others voluntarily go to for advice.

Flip the Pareto principle — invest 20% into culture and structure, get 80% back in self-improving code quality.

Wrote this up properly. Worth a read if you're navigating the same tension.
