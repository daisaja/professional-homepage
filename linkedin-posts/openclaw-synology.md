Eight hours. Eight errors. One NAS that kept questioning my life choices.

I thought setting up a self-hosted AI gateway on my Synology would take an afternoon. I know Docker. I have API keys. I was wrong in the most educational way possible.

The final boss: error 1008 "device token mismatch". Five hours of debugging. The fix was two lines of JSON. Somewhere that has to be fair.

OpenClaw is genuinely powerful — a single endpoint for Claude, GPT, and a dozen other providers. The Synology is a solid foundation. But the path there is not a walk in the park.

One piece of advice: enable SSH before you start. You will need it. You just don't know it yet.
