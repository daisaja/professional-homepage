Building a fully automated blog pipeline sounds like the dream—until you realize you've spent weeks training AI agents to write like you, only to end up writing *about* the pipeline itself.

So here's the plot twist: I just published an article about how I built this thing using Claude Code—and yes, the irony is intentional. The pipeline reads a Google Doc, runs it through specialized subagents (writer, style reviewer, translator, image ideator, image critic), generates images, and publishes everything. All with a single command. The kicker? This very article was written by the system it describes.

The manual GitHub Action trigger for LinkedIn posts? That's not laziness—that's intentional friction to prevent my AI agents from oversharing on your timeline.
